                        <p style="text-indent: 18px"> “Scientists dream about doing great things. Engineers do them.” - James Michener. Ever since I was
                        young both my parents and I knew I wanted to apply myself to something engineering related. As a sophomore in high school. I am
                        not yet certain what career path I want to take but I do plan on completing both high school and get a degree in a 4-year college,
                        likely with an engineering major. I like to tinker, I like to toy around with things until they break: pushing it to its limits
                        till it can’t deal with it anymore, and then I rebuild it. Any lego invention I ever spent hours building ended up only to be
                        desecrated within seconds of its birth. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 18px">If I am interested in something I stay determined or stay stubborn depending on how you look at it. Whenever I am handed a
                        problem and see that I am capable of it I will try everything I know and when that doesn’t  work I go to my best friend, Google.
                        From there I can spend hours of time finding out the fastest and easiest way to do something. Take for example the time when I
                        broke my iPhone. I had panicked but after I got after the sudden urge to be scared I got my wits together and went on the
                        internet, after about 30 minutes I thought about what I had at home that I could use. I found my mom’s old broken iPhone
                        (The phone hardware inside was broken, not the screen)  and over the next 2 hours I replaced my screen using my mom’s old phone’s
                        screen and a 20-minute youtube video. Thinking under pressure in this situation led me to discover and figure out something I had
                        no understanding of prior,
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 18px">Along with being academically proficient, I currently throw shot put and discus in track and field. We practice everyday and
                        learn to be patient and meticulous in technique.  Other skills I have are: basic programming skills in Ruby and Python, along
                        with a complete aptitude of Autodesk Inventor. I am currently in Principles of Engineering, Advanced Placement Statistics, and
                        Honors Chemistry, where I challenge myself everyday.
