                        <p style="text-indent: 18px"> “Hello! My name is Samraat Singh and I am currently a junior at Dublin High School. I have an
                        interest in both STEM and business/finance, however I am still undecided in what career path I want to pursue. In order to
                        further explore these interests I have taken multiple engineering courses and plan to take a business class next year. Outside
                        of school, I love working on my car and also trade stocks with my father. After completing high school I wish to attend a 
                        four-year college to earn a bachelor’s degree. After that I may attend grad school as well.  
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 18px">I am a very reserved person, I bring a calm and mellow attitude towards most situations and am
                        rarely stressed. This allows me to look at problems with a clear head and consider possible solutions. Take for example the time
                        I broke my iPhone 5s.  It was the third time in less than 6 months I knew my parents would be furious, but after the first 5
                        minutes of panic I realized freaking out would solve nothing and immediately went at solving the problem. I remembered we still
                        had my mom’s old iPhone that was internally damaged that could be used to fix my own screen. Using the internet, I spent the next
                        two hours transplanting my mom’s screen in replacement of my shattered one. Thinking under pressure and stress is one of my most
                        valuable skills that I can apply anywhere in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 18px">In high school I have maintained a cumulative 4.09 GPA, while competing in track and field the last
                        two years. This year I am enrolled in Advanced Placement Calculus, Advanced Placement Chemistry, and Computer Science Principles;
                        previously having completed courses in Principles of Engineering, Introduction to Engineering, and Biology. I am in the school
                        orchestra, meeting everyday an hour before school to practice. I also like to work out and push my body every time I am in the
                        gym. I know when I could have worked harder and like using that same mindset in the rest of my life in order to motivate me to
                        achieve more.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 18px">
                        In other words, I am a very dedicated individual who is well rounded and wants the best for himself and those around him. I want
                        to thank you for visiting my site and I invite you to explore my resume and projects, Thank you.
